~Use linear regression in one variable to fit the parameters to a model
~Use linear regression in multiple variables to fit the parameters to a model
~Use polynomial regression in a single variable to fit the parameters to a model
~Create a pipeline for performing linear regression using multiple features in polynomial scaling
~Use the grid search with cross-validation and ridge regression to create a model with optimum hyperparameters
