# Laptop-Price-Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices using different regression techniques. The goal is to model the relationship between housing prices and multiple features, including but not limited to the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and various other factors. The project employs several regression models to fit the data, including linear regression (single and multiple variables), polynomial regression, and ridge regression with cross-validation. 

~Use linear regression in one variable to fit the parameters to a model
---
~Use linear regression in multiple variables to fit the parameters to a model
---
~Use polynomial regression in a single variable to fit the parameters to a model
---
~Create a pipeline for performing linear regression using multiple features in polynomial scaling
---
~Use the grid search with cross-validation and ridge regression to create a model with optimum hyperparameters
